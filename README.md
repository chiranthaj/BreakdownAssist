# BreakdownAssist
BreakdownAssist is developed for Ceylon Electricity Board, Sri Lanka and this is an in-house development. 

Initially purpose of this was assist the field crew by displaying the locations of electricity breakdowns because finding the location of the customer is essential, but yet difficult in most of the time. This app answers to that major problem encountered in electricity breakdown handling, in Sri Lanka.  

Methodology
===========
A large screen TAB is used to run this app in the breakdown vehicle and the breakdown jobs (which are received by the Contact Center) are transmitted via SMS to the TAB. SMS is used here because of two reasons. 

The main reason is the availability of the service. SMSs can be received even in very weak mobile signal level, which will definitely increase the availability of the communication.

The next reason is, SMS being the only way to keep the connectivity with the software which is used in the Contact Center. :)
